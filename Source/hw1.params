Notes:

1)  Selection Type Codes    1 = Proportional Selection
							2 = Tournament Selection
							3 = Random Selection

2)  Fitness Scaling Type    0 = Scale for Maximization (no change to raw fitness)
							1 = Scale for Minimization (reciprocal of raw fitness)
							2 = Rank for Maximization
							3 = Rank for Minimization

3)  Crossover Type Codes    1 = Single Point Crossover
							2 = Two Point Crossover
							3 = Uniform Crossover
							4 = OX1


4)  Crossover Rates from 0 to 1, Use "0" to turn off crossover

5)  Mutation Type Codes     1 = Flip Bit
							              2 = ISM + DM

6)  Mutation Rates from 0 to 1, Use "0" to turn off mutation (Doesn't do anything if mutation type = 2)

7)  Probability of **at least** 1 ISM is p, probability of n+1 ISMs given n ISMs is p, prob (0) = 1-p. Probability is per individual

8)  Probability of 1 DM is p, prob of 0 is 1-p, size of DM window is cities/10

9)  Represents number of genes in each chromosome. (number of cities if problem is TSP)

10) Determines number of bits in each gene.  Number of Genes times Size
	gives the number of bits in each chromosome. (doesn't do anything for TSP)
