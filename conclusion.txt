In conclusion, the Traveling Salesman Problem is a difficult problem that does not have a one size fits all solution, even with Genetic Algorithms. We found that the performance of GAs on Traveling Salesman Problems significantly depend on the input cities provided, different inputs will need different parameters and may even perform better with different problem representations. In general the path representation with genetic edge recombination and insertion mutation is a good genetic algorithm for medium sized problems. A GA with an extremely small population and many generations may perform well on problems with a large amount of cities. The ordinal representation searches the search space almost randomly, however, the GA proves it is not fully random. The operators do not make sense intuitively, however the results are not very poor. The path representation is very intuitive, however its crossover operators are complicated and computationally expensive. Each representation has tradeoffs. In general, we found that Genetic Algorithms are good for finding a pretty good solution quickly. Furthermore, the parameters and representation may need tuning to the specific input.
